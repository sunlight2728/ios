This folder contains empty placeholder fonts which are replaced with licensed versions by Jenkins during a release.

Developers: you may replace the placeholder font files with their licensed counterparts locally however you must not commit these to source control. You can run `git update-index --assume-unchanged *.otf` to stop git tracking changes you make to these files.
